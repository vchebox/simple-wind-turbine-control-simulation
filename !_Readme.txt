The file collection can be used in engineering education for practical sessions of the "Automatic Control and Protection of Power Plants with Renewable Energy Sources" course and some similar ones. It contains a simplified nonlinear dynamic model of a horizontal-axis wind power plant, incorporating a power control circuit through pitch angle adjustment. 
The model has been developed to run in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.
The model is extremely simple so may be used in teaching bachelor course students as well as master course students.

The model and corresponding teaching methods will be described in details in a journal paper very soon.
Look for this paper!
